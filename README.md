### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Top, and I'm working towards becoming a data engineer. 
I'm planning to learn about the technologies and tools in data engineering, such as Apache Spark, Hadoop, and Kafka, to build scalable data pipelines.
I am passionate to learn about building data pipelines and creating efficient workflows that make data analysis easier.
I'm committed to mastering the skills required to be an effective data engineer.
I'm always looking for opportunities to collaborate with others in the data analytics community to share knowledge and best practices.

As a beginner in the field, I'm eager to learn from others and collaborate on projects. 
I believe that sharing knowledge and best practices is essential for growth and success.
